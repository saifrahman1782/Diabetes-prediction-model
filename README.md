# Diabetes prediction model using logistic regression

This project was created with the intent of creating a linear machine learning model using logistic regression in order to accurately predict the onset of diabetes in patients.
This was achieved by looking at several different attributes in regards to each patient and determining if these attributes directly attributed towards a patients diagnosis of diabetes.
